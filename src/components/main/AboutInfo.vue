      Odds and evens is a simple game of chance and hand game, 
      involving two people simultaneously revealing a number 
      of fingers and winning or losing depending on whether they 
      are odd or even, or alternatively involving one person 
      picking up coins or other small objects and hiding them 
      in their closed hand, while another player guesses whether 
      they have an odd or even number. The game may be used to make 
      a decision or played for fun. The finger game is also known 
      as swords, choosies, pick, odds-on poke, or bucking up.[1] 
      This zero-sum game, a variation of the ancient morra and 
      par-impar,[2] is played in Europe, the US, and in Brazil, 
      especially among children.
